## Project Schedule

- shows the relationship of the project activities and tasks
- shows the dependencies (task follow other tasks)
- 특정 milestone에 도달하는 방법의 수는 여러가지. 방법들 중 짧은 경로를 선택하는 것이 핵심

- Critical Path
- Float Time (slack time)

## Project Diagrams

- Gantt Chart
- Network Diagram
  - AOA(Activity On Arrow)
  - AON(Activity on Node)
  - PERT Chart (an early AON Diagram)
- CPM (Critical Path Method)

## Project Schedule?

- Tasks across a timeline
- Road map
  - project
  - project manager
  - customers and shakeholders
- Communication tool
- Tracking tool

## How Construct Schedule

- Move the detailed tasks to the schedule
- Add the task durations
- Arrange the tasks into the sequential or simultaneous relationships
- Add the initial start or finish of the overall project
- Add the early and late start and finish times
- Add what other information you might want, such as team memebers' names to tasks and costs
- WBS (Go To Work) -> Network Diagram (AON format) -> Gantt Chart
- 한개 노드에 duration을 적고, ES, LS, EF, LF 의 경우를 적는다. (Early Start, Late Start, Early Finish, Late Finish)
- 한계와 위험을 고려하여 critical path 수정
- 간트 차트에 Dead date를 설정하여 속도 조절

## Two Late Resorts

- Reduce the Scope
- Reduce the Quality
